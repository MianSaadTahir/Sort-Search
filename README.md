# Sort-Search

**Sort-Search** is a Python desktop application which implements a robust data sorting and searching system, where data is scraped from Flipkart. The dataset consists of 25,000 entities, each with 7 attributes, and is stored in a CSV file. The project features a user-friendly interface built with PyQt, allowing users to apply 10 different sorting algorithms and perform advanced multi-column searches using various criteria, including "start with," "end with," and logical operators (AND, OR).
